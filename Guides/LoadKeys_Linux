This document was a long time coming. It's part 1 of 3 of my Keyboard Mappings Series in Linux (and compatibles).
After a lot of research and procrastination I've finally done completed it :P.

In Linux there are 3 types of keyboard layout types (each more powerful and complicated than the next...):

* LoadKeys
* XModMap
* XKB (2 isn't complete yet, unfortunately)


For part 1, we're going to talk about LoadKeys


LoadKeys is the keymap used by the Linux kernel before you boot into your X Server.
Fairly simplistic, but is not very well documented...

If you don't know what the X Server is, this is probably not the correct guide for you (XModMap or XKB is probably what you are looking for).


SECTION - Useful Tools

loadkeys - It's how you set your keymap (remember to run as root)
dumpkeys - Can give you a dump of your current keymap, as well as all of the possible keysyms (doesn't tell you what they do unfortunately)
showkey - Nice tool for determining keycodes and key outputs. If a key doesn't output anything but it should (e.g. Not an FN key) then read the man page, as you need to specify some kernel boot opitions (See the **Big-Backspace Mod**)



SECTION - Useful man pages

If you're serious about learning what makes LoadKeys tick, then:

man keymaps

is a good place to start.
