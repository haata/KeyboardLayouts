This document was a long time coming. It's part 3 of 3 of my Keyboard Mappings Series in Linux (and compatibles).
After a lot of research and procrastination I've finally done completed it :P.

In Linux there are 3 types of keyboard layout types (each more powerful and complicated than the next...):

* LoadKeys
* XModMap
* XKB (2 isn't complete yet, unfortunately)

*Disclamier*

I am not an authority on XKB. This document is a compilation of the available documentation, plus additions by me for use with very complicated layouts.

Also, in comparison to parts 1 and 2, this one is very very long. You'll need a few days to digest the information here. So I recommend you start reading this guide with a goal in mind, as you'll be able to skip over the parts that are not relevant to you.

You may just decide to skip to the ending sections and read my recommended usage and hints sections.
